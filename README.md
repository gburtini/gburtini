### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

There's an assortment of personal hobby projects here, but due to intellectual property rights and non-disclosure agreements, the majority of my work takes place in private repositories. Largely _nothing_ publicly available should be assumed to be production ready, but I'm happy to chat if you need a hand applying anything you find here.

## âš¡ Selected Projects

A gently curated list of projects that might have some more general public interest value.

- Github Flat repositories for the ongoing collection of data such as [the coefficients necessary for computing Canadian personal income taxes](https://github.com/gburtini/flat-canada-tax-coefficients) and a [simple collection of macroeconomic indicators](https://github.com/gburtini/flat-price-earnings-data).
- An initial take on (mostly closed-form) PDF, CDF and sampling functions for [various probability distributions in PHP](https://github.com/gburtini/Probability-Distributions-for-PHP).
- A cool little tool for [generalizing XPath selectors](https://github.com/gburtini/Potent) and recovery of underlying [Firebug implementation details](https://github.com/gburtini/potent-tools-for-xpath). Used for producing a semi-automated data scraping interface, where users could click examples of what they want to collect and have the Potent function generalize the selector.
- [passport-masquerade](https://github.com/gburtini/passport-masquerade), a straightforward, mostly "drop-in", passport middleware for allowing privileged users to impersonate other users.
